Keytree is a next-generation open public-key infrastructure.

Keytree is federated and has no central servers. Anyone can run a Keytree
server. I ran a server on https://keytree.io, and you can run your own server
by downloading the code using "go get
github.com/jellevandenhooff/keytree/keytree-server" and running
"keytree-server".

To register an e-mail address with Keytree, download and run "keytree-client".

This repository is under development. The code has not been audited and most
definitely contains bugs.
